## Introduction

"A picture is worth a thousand words" - this statement stands true even in the realm of electronics. Oscilloscopes are the photo cameras for an engineer. 
Although a professional oscilloscope would be the best choice, sometimes as a hobbyist you just need a simple, yet practical way of analysing signals.
Introduce comments about Arduino processing power and the ADC, the fact that you don't need any parts to get you going.

show and tell, here it would be good an youtube video link

diagram of an Arduino uno hooked up to a signal generator, Arudino agent to pickup the data and the web interface to show the web interface.

## Hot it works (show)

Describe how picking up the signal works and a bit about the UI interface, probably a few more pictures are needed.

## Web interface (show)

Describe the web interface and how it works, with an image.

## Installing (tell)

Step by step on how to install the code on arduino, arduino agent, configuring arduino agent

## Usage

Describe how to start the interface, what to click and measuring your first signal, using the trigger rising and falling.

## Deep dive

Focus on a few things, more on the arudino code and less on the client code.
- timers and ADC, frequency and configuration
- communication between arduino and client

## Conclusion
