## Introduction

This seems like a silly thing to do, however this proved to be a rather small and interesting project. In my quest for powering up a simple ATtiny85 sensor using a coin battery,
such as CR2016 or CR2032, I have started being more interested in understanding how one might try to report the remaining battery life 
using the internal analog-to-digital converter of the Atmel chip. This sparked in my head a simple Arduino battery discharger project, that will discharge a coin batter using a
transistor, a resistor and an Arduino UNO.
