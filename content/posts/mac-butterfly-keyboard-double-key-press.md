## Introduction
If you have a mac with a butterfly keyboard, you most probably already know and have experience the most common issue that comes with it: doubling of the pressed keys.

Searching the web for this issues will yield all sort of results that will most likely point to a "dust" problem that accompanies these keyboards. While this might be a legitimate reason, this was not necessary the case for me. 

Having a look at the way the keyboard is built, it does come close to the keyboards found in the old mobile phones that suffered from the same constraints: slim profile devices with not enough space to fit in a proper keyboard. In order to create two contact leads that can be pressed against each other to form a switch, you could use the PCB board as one lead and a thin plastic or metal foil on top as the second lead. The same metal or plastic foil can act as a string too in order to push the button back after is has been pressed. This is perfectly fine for buttons that are meant to be pressed from time to time, but when we are talking about a keyboard that needs to be used daily, the mechanics need to be a little bit different, hence normal profile keyboards that last a lifetime.

## How to fix it

Apple butterfly keyboards suffer physical damage after months of use and this will show as doubling of the keys being pressed. This is nothing but an imperfect electrical contact.

* How to fix this? By replacing the damaged lead (i.e. the plastic foil), but this is expensive.
* How to prolong the keyboard life?
    * Using a software that prevents doubling of the keys. Easy!
    * Tweaking the keys by extending the electrical contact area. Requires dexterity and effort.

## Using Unshaky

A software that addressed just that, preventing a key to register multiple sequential clicks.
